            <h2>Our Trip</h2>
            <p class="overview">
               This summer, my family and I are planning to take a cross country trip from Pennsylvania to Santa Fe, NM. We will first drive to Pittsburgh and stay the night, then on to Chicago and stay the night before bording an overnight Amtrak train to Albuquerque. From there we will rent a car and drive about an hour northeast to Santa Fe. We will stay in Santa Fe for six days and explore the surrounding natural beauty of the great SouthWest. Our return trip will be a reversed, with the overnight train from Albuquerque to Chicago, another overnight in the Windy City before heading to Pittsburgh and overnight before finally heading home. It will be an adventure and we are looking forward to it!

            <p>We will stay for one night in Pittsburgh both going to and coming back from Santa Fe. We will stay in the Three Rivers section of downtown, which is named that because it is where the Allegheny and the Monongahela rivers meet to form the third, the Ohio River. It is close to many museums, including the Carnegie Museums <a href="https://carnegiemuseums.org" target="_blank">Carnegie Museums</a> and <a href="https://www.warhol.org" target="_blank">the warhol.</a></p>

            <p>We will drive from Pittsburgh to Chicago (a heafty 7-8 hours) and stay overnight in Chicago near <a href="https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/grant-ulysses-park" target="_blank">Grant Park</a> right on the shore of Lake Michigan. While I'm sure my kids would love to catch a game at <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cubs/ballpark" target="_blank">Wrigley Field</a>, I think we'll probably only have time for a walk through the park and a splash in the hotel pool before moving on to the next leg of our journey.</p>
